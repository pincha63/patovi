There are 3 files one writes:
  package.json
  server.js
  index.html
The first two are generic (server will eventually have the routes/endpoints)
The third one contains (or references) all the HTML, CSS and client-side JS that goes into the website.
Port is 3000 but can be configured


************ to kill the processes: taskkill /im node.exe /F
